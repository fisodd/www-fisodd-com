Hugo Restructured
#################

Hugo Restructured is a theme for `Hugo <https://gohugo.io/>`__
that exploits
`reStructuredText <https://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`__
markup to enable rich formatting and page layout
within a simple markdown system.

Full information about the theme can be found in the
`repository at Github <https://github.com/fisodd/hugo-restructured>`__.
For a live demonstration with more information about
features and techniques visit
`the live demo site <https://hugo-restructured-demo.netlify.com/>`__.

A Note On Styling
-----------------

The default configuration for Hugo Restructured uses gradients in
shades of red.  This is easily customized to suit a website's style,
or tuned to accommodate the needs of a specific page or to differentiate
between sections of a site.

The theme uses Hugo variables to define a color, or an image, or
a gradient to use for the top-of-page "splash" and the "edge" areas
exposed as the page responds to wide screen layouts.
See `Page Coloring
<https://hugo-restructured-demo.netlify.com/post/configuring/#page-coloring>`__.


Acknowlegements
***************

:title:`Hugo Restructured` started as an attempt to understand
the very useful
`Ananke Theme <https://themes.gohugo.io/gohugo-theme-ananke/>`__.

`Bud Parr <https://github.com/budparr>`__
has done us all a great favor with his careful development of this theme.
Ananke proved to be one of the better teaching tools I have found
for understanding how templates actually work in Hugo.

Again, many thanks to
`all the folks <https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/graphs/contributors>`__
who make Hugo such an effective tool.

CSView is a Customizable Summary Viewer for CSV content,
including dynamic tables and responsive charts.

The intent is to provide a quick and easy way
to get to see what is inside CSV content.

Rationale
#########

Maybe you are better organized than I am,
but sometimes I find myself with way too many different CSV files
to keep straight which abbreviated filename goes with which case.

.. sidebar:: Chart Shot
   :class: titleless

   .. image:: csview-chart.png
      :align: right
      :width: 100%

Which dateset is without the column of labels?
Which dataset has the extraneous rows trimmed out?
Which dataset has the latest data?
Which dataset was the one where the peak values were notably higher?

CSV is easy enough to load into a text editor,
but editors can be awkward when the lines are long
and the content is not regular,
and sorting by the Nth column is not an editor's common usage.

Spreadsheets certainly can manage CSV files,
but these can be overkill just to check what columns are well populated,
and while spreadsheets can do almost anything
they can be cumbersome to throw up a quick chart
and often take more than a few clicks
to experiement with which columns to use as the axes in a chart.

CSView offers one way to quickly load a file
and then play around with the contents
either in a tabular view or in a chart graphic.

CSView is a quick data exploration tool.
It is not meant for generating presentation materials,
there are better tools for when fine control of the data and the display
makes for better looking results.
However, there are times when a lightweight tool
is more effective than a full-function system.

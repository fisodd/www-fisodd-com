   If Data begets Knowledge,
   then Knowledge together with Insight can raise Understanding.

Welcome to `Fisodd </post/f-is-odd/>`__.

A home for some of `Alexander Carlton's </info/alexander>`__
ongoing work;
including projects in website implementations as well as
data visualizations and other data science related activities.

Much of the material here is to expand upon
`the author's public repositories at Github <https://github.com/fisodd>`__.
Some of the rest are demos (or experiments) from an ongoing exploration
of methods to visualize and deliver what is uncovered by Data Science.

A few examples are listed below.  Everything on this site
can be found within the sections listed in the menu across the top of the page.

Questions, comments, or project ideas are all
`welcome <mailto:info@fisodd.com>`__.

Tufte Example

.. sidebar:: Quoting directly from "Tufte CSS"

   Tufte CSS provides tools to style web articles using the ideas demonstrated by Edward Tufte’s books and handouts. Tufte’s style is known for its simplicity, extensive use of sidenotes, tight integration of graphics with text, and carefully chosen typography.
   
   Tufte CSS was created by
   `Dave Liepmann <http://www.daveliepmann.com>`_
   and is now an Edward Tufte project.
   The original idea was cribbed from
   `Tufte-LaTeX <https://tufte-latex.github.io/tufte-latex/>`_
   and
   `R Markdown’s Tufte Handout format <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/tufte_handout_format.html>`_.
   We give hearty thanks to all the people who have contributed to those projects.
   
   If you see anything that Tufte CSS could improve,
   we welcome your contribution
   in the form of an issue or pull request
   on the GitHub project:
   `tufte-css <https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css>`_.
   Please note the `contribution guidelines <https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css#contributing>`_.
   
   Finally, a reminder about the goal of this project.
   The web is not print. Webpages are not books.
   Therefore, the goal of Tufte CSS is not
   to say “websites should look like this interpretation of Tufte’s books”
   but rather “here are some techniques Tufte developed
   that we’ve found useful in print;
   maybe you can find a way to make them useful on the web”.
   Tufte CSS is merely a sketch of one way to implement
   this particular set of ideas.
   It should be a starting point, not a design goal,
   because any project should present their information
   as best suits their particular circumstances.

   -- From https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/

The page you are reading is an adaptation of the
`Tufte CSS <https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/>`__ example page,
which itself is a sample page used to demonstrate the features
of a set of CSS that enabled certain web materials to follow
ideas expressed in Edward Tufte's work.

This page here is offered as an example of
how this kind of material can be written in
`reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_
through the use of
`the B-side theme <https://github.com/fisodd/hugo-b-side/>`__
in Hugo,
and how the behavior has evolved to work
within the constraints of Hugo and this B-side theme.
The content and the flow of the material on this page
follow directly from the original Tufte CSS page,
adjustments were made as necessary
to fit the specifics of the B-side implementation.

This B-side Hugo theme
does not attempt to adhere strictly to Tufte's work,
but has been influenced by his writings.
The development of the B-side theme has also been influenced
by other projects which have spun out of the Tufte CSS work, 
with the most obvious alternative contributions coming from
`Envisioned CSS <http://nogginfuel.com/envisioned-css/>`_.

Those interested in a pure CSS implementation following Tufte's designs
are encouraged to consider the excellent Tufte CSS project.
You can start by exploring the links in the original Tufte CSS material
that is quoted in the sidebar to the right of this text.
Those interested in similar behavior
with a cleaner "modern" aesethic
should review the Envisioned CSS project referenced above.


Getting Started
---------------

B-side requires no special setup
to be used in this main-and-margin column format -- 
all that is required is some care with using reStructuredText directives
and the CSS in B-side will format the resulting elements accordingly.


Fundamentals
------------

Sections and Headings
.....................

Organize your document
like any other reStructuredText document.
The B-side CSS is based on the HTML generated
by the default Docutils processing of reStructuredText markup.

For approximating this Tufte look,
use the top-level heading for the document title,
and the second-level headings for section headings,
with the third-level headings for low-level headings.
All of the HTML recognized headings (H1 through H6) are supported,
but are not in keeping with Tufte guidance.
If you feel the urge to reach for a heading of level 4 or greater,
consider redesigning your document:

   [It is] notable that the Feynman lectures (3 volumes)
   write about all of physics in 1800 pages,
   using only 2 levels of hierarchical headings:
   chapters and A-level heads in the text.
   It also uses the methodology of *sentences*
   which then cumulate sequentially into *paragraphs*,
   rather than the grunts of bullet points.
   Undergraduate Caltech physics is very complicated material,
   but it didn’t require an elaborate hierarchy to organize.

   --- Edward Tufte,
   `forum post <http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0000hB>`_,
   ‘Book design: advice and examples’ thread

As a bonus,
this excerpt regarding the use of headings provides an example of block quotes.
In reStructuredText they result in semantically correct HTML
using ``blockquote`` and ``attribution`` elements,
which are then lightly styled in the B-side CSS.
See page 20 of
`The Visual Display of Quantitative Information <https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi>`_
for an example in print.

.. role:: newthought

:newthought:`In his later books` Tufte
starts each section with a bit of vertical space,
a non-indented paragraph,
and the first few words of the sentence set in small caps.
For this we use a reStructuredText ``role`` with the class ``newthought``,
as demonstrated at the beginning of this paragraph.
Admittedly, the support for this feature in B-side is
simplistic -- simple markup does not offer a proper
implementation of small caps, so here we are making do
with a hack with upper case lettering (hence we lack
some of the notable details such as size differentiation
of the capital letters in the new thought phrase).

.. code:: ReST

   .. role:: newthought
   
   :newthought:`In his later books` Tufte
   starts each section with a bit of vertical space,

Whichever approach you choose for the start of your sections,
be consistent.
Do not alternate use of header elements and the newthought technique.
Pick one approach and stick to it.


Text
....

Although paper handouts obviously have a pure white background,
the web is better served by the use of slightly off-white and off-black colors.
The B-side theme uses ``#fffff6`` and ``#111111``
which are mostly indistinguishable from their ‘pure’ cousins,
but dial down the harsh contrast and lean a bit towards warmer hues.
We stick to the greyscale for text,
reserving color for the content's specific,
careful use in figures and images.

.. [1] See Tufte’s comment in the `Tufte book fonts thread <http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0000Vt>`_.

In print, Tufte has used the proprietary Monotype Bembo\ [1]_ font.
Here we break from the Tufte guidance,
and follow closer to the approach championed by
`Envisioned CSS <http://nogginfuel.com/envisioned-css/>`_.
The B-side theme is based on the Google ``Roboto`` font.
Arguably not as nice as Bembo or even
the now open-source
`ETBook <https://github.com/edwardtufte/et-book>`_,
B-side acknowleges that the web is not print;
web lacks the fine resolution that make good serifs a joy to read,
web also lacks the predicability that comes from pre-printed ink and paper.

.. sidebar:: Roboto
   :class: titleless

   Regardless of its
   `faults
   <http://typographica.org/on-typography/roboto-typeface-is-a-four-headed-frankenstein/>`__
   in design,
   Roboto's implementation is increasingly well tuned
   for availability and readability on a range of web devices,
   and this can make for more effective results in many modern web pages
   where many of the concerns of good typography
   are well outside the control of the content developers.

The B-side theme does explictly load the bold and italic variants of Roboto
for bold (strong) and italic (emphasis),
instead of relying on the browser to mechanically transform the text.
This is typographic best practice.
If necessary, B-side will degrade to load
``Ariel`` (common on Windows-based systems),
``Helvetica`` (common on the Apple systems),
and fall back to the bare ``sans-serif`` in the worst case.

.. sidebar:: Blue Text
   :class: titleless

   Blue text, while also a widely recognizable clickable-text indicator, is crass and distracting. Luckily, it is also rendered unnecessary by the use of underlining.

.. _`dummy example link`:

Links in B-side CSS match the body text in color
and do not change on mouseover or when clicked.
Here is a `dummy example link`_ that goes nowhere.
These links are underlined,
since this is the most widely recognized indicator of clickable text.

However,
because most browsers’ default underlining does not clear descenders
and is so thick and distracting,
the underline effect is instead achieved using CSS trickery
involving background gradients
instead of standard ``text-decoration``.
Credit goes to Adam Schwartz for the technique --
we are impressed, and grateful.


Epigraphs
---------

.. epigraph::

   The English language . . . becomes ugly and inaccurate
   because our thoughts are foolish,
   but the slovenliness of our language
   makes it easier for us to have foolish thoughts.

   --- George Orwell, “Politics and the English Language”

   For a successful technology,
   reality must take precedence over public relations,
   for Nature cannot be fooled.

   --- Richard P. Feynman, “What Do You Care What Other People Think?”

   I do not paint things, I paint only the differences between things.
   
   --- Henri Matisse,
   :title:`Henri Matisse Dessins: thèmes et variations`
   (Paris, 1943), 37

.. [#] `Beautiful Evidence <http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_be>`__

If you’d like to introduce your page or a section of your page
with some quotes, use epigraphs.
Modeled after chapter epigraphs in Tufte’s books
(particularly *Beautiful Evidence* [#]_),
these are ``blockquote`` elements with a bit of specialized styling.
Quoted text is italicized.
The source goes in a ``attribute`` element inside the ``blockquote``.
We have provided three examples in the epigraph of this section,
demonstrating shorter and longer quotes,
with and without a paragraph tag,
and showing how multiple quotes within an epigraph
fit together with the use of a wrapper class.


Sidenotes: Footnotes and Marginal Notes
---------------------------------------

.. [*] This is a sidenote.

One of the most distinctive features of Tufte’s style
is his extensive use of sidenotes\ [*]_.
Sidenotes are like footnotes,
except they don’t force the reader
to jump their eye to the bottom of the page,
but instead display off to the side in the margin.
The B-side theme implements both notes, footnotes and sidenotes,
with the same place-in-the-margin behavior.

In reStructuredText, notes (whether footnotes or sidenotes)
can be where ever the author wants in document.  To use as
sidenotes with B-side, define the sidenote where you want
the sidenote to appear (usually close to where the note is
referenced from).

.. code:: ReST

   .. [*] This is a sidenote.

Sidenotes are a great example of the web not being like print.
On sufficiently large viewports, the B-side theme uses the margin
for sidenotes, margin notes, and small figures.
On smaller viewports,
elements that would go in the margin are
pushed to the right-hand edge and isolated as separate elements
with different line-spacing and other visual cues
to create some separation.
The goal is to present related but not necessary information
such as asides or citations *as close as possible* to the text
that references them.
At the same time,
this secondary information should stay out of the way of the eye,
not interfering with the progression of ideas in the main text.

If you want a sidenote without footnote-style numberings,
then you want a margin note, which we implement using
reStructuredText's ``sidebar`` directive.

.. sidebar:: Margin Note
   :class: titleless

   This is a margin note. Notice there isn’t a number preceding the note.

On large screens,
a margin note is just a sidenote that omits the reference number.
This lessens the distracting effect taking away from the flow of the main text,
but can increase the cognitive load
of matching a margin note to its referent text.
However, on small screens,
both margin notes and sidenotes
are implemented as text boxes pushed out to the right edge.

An example of how to mark up a margin note by use of a sidebar:

.. code:: ReST

   .. sidebar:: Margin Note
      :class: titleless

      This is a margin note. Notice there isn’t a number preceding the note.

Note: no plaintext markup solution is going to be able to manage
all of the careful details that make books like those of Edward Tufte
such a pleasure to read -- much of that elegance comes from taking
great care to get the details right, and plaintext markup systems
favor simplicity more than fine-grain details.

.. [*] This note was defined above the paragraph.

One of those details that is compromised
is the exact placement of these notes.
In Tufte CSS, by using raw HTML one has character-level control
over the placement of notes
(a note, whether marginnote or footnote,
can be tied to any specific word in the running text).
Like most plaintext markup systems
that favor readability of the raw material,
reStructuredText works mostly with blocks of text
as opposed to working character by character.
Therefore, with B-side, notes can be implemented
at the beginning\ [*]_ or at the end of a block\ [*]_,
not in the middle of a block of text.
Notes will be placed in the margin
starting at the same vertical position
as the next paragraph
in the text running in the main column.
If desired, a footnote\ [*]_ can be implemented
by placing one or more notes at the end of the markup text.

.. [*] This note was defined below the paragraph.

The careful reader may have noted
that some of the notes in this article
have been marked with numeric labels
while others have been marked with symbols.
reStructuredText actually implements three different sets of notes:
numeric notes, symbolic notes, and citations.
Each of these sets are tracked independently,
which offers an author some flexibility in how the notes are used;
for example, perhaps an author can use the symbolic notes
for the sidenotes and use the numeric notes for footnotes.
More information about the support for notes
can be found in
`the footnote section <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#footnotes>`__
of [ReST]_.


Figures
-------

Tufte emphasizes tight integration of graphics with text.
Data, graphs, and figures are kept with the text that discusses them.
In print, this means they are not relegated to a separate page.
On the web, that means readability of graphics
and their accompanying text without extra clicks,
tab-switching, or scrolling.

Figures should try to use the ``figure`` directive,
which by default are constrained to the main column.
For example, most of the time
one should introduce a figure directly into the main flow of discussion,
like so:

.. figure:: 1786_Playfair_Export_Import.jpg
   :alt: Exports and Imports to and from Denmark & Norway from 1700 to 1780
   :align: left

   After an image from Edward Tufte,
   *Visual Display of Quantitative Information*, page 92
   [JPG file from `Wikimedia Commons: 1786 Playfair`_]

The figure above can be implemented with:

.. code:: ReST

   .. figure:: 1786_Playfair_Export_Import.jpg
      :alt: Exports and Imports to and from Denmark & Norway from 1700 to 1780
      :align: left

      After an image from Edward Tufte, etc...

.. _`Wikimedia Commons: 1786 Playfair`:
   https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:1786_Playfair_-_5_Export_%26_Import_to_and_from_all_North_America_from_1700_to_1800_(from_3e_edition,_1801).jpg



.. sidebar:: rhino
   :class: titleless

   .. figure:: Rhinoceros.jpg
      :alt: Image of a Rhinoceros"

      F.J. Cole,
      “The History of Albrecht Dürer’s Rhinoceros in Zooological Literature,”
      :t:`Science, Medicine, and History:
      Essays on the Evolution of Scientific Thought and Medical Practice`
      (London, 1953), ed. E. Ashworth Underwood, 337-356.
      From page 71 of Edward Tufte’s *Visual Explanations*
      [JPG file from `Wikimedia Commons: Durer's Rhinoceros`_]

.. _`Wikimedia Commons: Durer's Rhinoceros`:
   https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:D%C3%BCrer%27s_Rhinoceros,_1515.jpg

But tight integration of graphics with text
is central to Tufte’s work
even when those graphics are ancillary to the main body of a text.
In many of those cases,
a margin figure may be most appropriate.
To place figures in the margin,
just place the ``figure`` within a ``sidebar`` directive
as seen to the right of this paragraph.

An example implementation of a figure within a sidebar:

.. code:: ReST

   .. sidebar:: rhino
      :class: titleless

      .. figure:: Rhinoceros.jpg
         :alt: Image of a Rhinoceros"

         F.J. Cole, etc...

If you need a full-width figure, add the ``fullwidth`` class
to the figure directive
and it will take up (almost) the full width of the screen.
This approach is demonstrated below
using Edward Tufte’s English translation of
the Napoleon’s March data visualization.
From *Beautiful Evidence*, page 122-124.

.. figure:: Minard.png
   :alt: Figurative map of the successive losses of the French Army in the Russian campaign, 1812-1813
   :class: fullwidth

   Figurative map of the successive losses of the French Army
   in the Russian campaign, 1812-1813
   [PNG file from `Wikimedia Commons: Minard`_]
  
.. _`Wikimedia Commons: Minard`:
   https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Minard.png

In markup:

.. code:: ReST

   .. figure:: Minard.png
      :alt: Figurative map of the successive losses ...
      :class: fullwidth

      Figurative map of the successive losses of the French Army ...
  

Code
----

Technical jargon, programming language terms, and code samples
are denoted with the ``code`` directive,
as I’ve been using in this document to denote HTML.
Code needs to be monospace for formatting purposes
and to aid in code analysis,
but it must maintain its readability.
To those ends, B-side utilizes ``Roboto Mono``
for a fixed-width font consistent with the base font.

Epilogue
--------

Many thanks go to Edward Tufte for leading the way with his work.
And without the fine work of Dave Liepmann and his Tufte CSS project
we would not have known even where to begin.
Any problems with this material
stem from failures in my implementation
and not from any weaknesses in their inspirations.


.. [*] This note behaves like a footnote
   because the note itself was defined at the very end of the text.
